## Create User - (Persona: Administrator)

<blockquote>
	<font color="blue">
		<p>
			IDCS supports user (also groups) on-boarding from on-premise 			<b>Active Directory</b>, using file upload, REST API, on-premise 			<b>Oracle Identity Management</b> solution, or manually from IDCS 			admin console.
		</p>
	</font>
</blockquote>

For the exercise we will be manually creating a user from admin console.

- On the **Users** page, click on the **Add** button. 

![](images/100/100-9-1-1.png)

## Configure multi-factor authentication - (Persona: Administrator)

<blockquote>
	<font color="blue">
		<p>
			When a user signs in to an application, they are prompted for their 			user name and password, which is the first factor – something that 			they know. With <b>Multi Factor Authentication (MFA)</b> enabled in 			Oracle Identity Cloud Service, the user is then required to provide 			a second type of verification. This is called <b>2-Step 			Verification</b>.
		</p>
		<p>
			The two factors work together to add an additional layer of security 			by using either additional information or a second device to verify 			the user’s identity and complete the login process.
		</p>
	</font>
</blockquote>

## Configure SSO for an app - (Persona: Administrator)

<blockquote>
	<font color="blue">
		<p>
			Oracle Identity Cloud Service(IDCS) provides integration with any 			service that can be integrated via <b>SAML</b> (Security Access 			Markup Language) protocol. Administrations will be able to manage 			users into various applications via single control panel and end 			users will be able to get to applications via single click.
		</p>
		<p>
			IDCS provides support for standard SAML 2.0 browser POST login & 			logout profiles.
		</p>
	</font>
</blockquote>


In this hands-on exercise, we will setup integration with **Salesforce** using SAML. IDCS will act as **IdP** (Identity Provider) and Salesforce org as **SP** (Service Provider also known as a Relying Party)

- Download and save IDCS Metadata to a local XML file for your instance. Metadata is available from the following location- 
<blockquote>
	<font color="red">
		https://idcs-xxxxxx.identity.oraclecloud.com/fed/v1/metadata
	</font>
	<font color="blue">
		<br>where idcs-xxxxxx is your IDCS tenant name that you can grab from the browser URL of your IDCS console. Copy-paste the constructed URL on a new browser tab and save the XML file locally.
	</font>
</blockquote>

![](images/100/100-16.png)

<blockquote>
		<font color="red">
			Following activities on Salesforce is optional. Email the metadata XML to your proctor.
		</font>
</blockquote>
